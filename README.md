# Data Analysis Project: [ecommerce-dataset-sql-python-project]
This project analyzes a dataset from Kaggle using both SQL and Python. It includes SQL queries for database manipulation and analysis, along with a Jupyter Notebook that runs those queries, processes the data, and visualizes the results.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is available on Kaggle. You can download it from the following link:
- [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/devarajv88/target-dataset?select=products.csv]
**Note**: The dataset is not included in this repository. Please download it from Kaggle and use the provided link in your local environment.

### Dataset Description
Target is a globally recognized brand and a leading retailer in the United States, known for offering exceptional value, inspiration, innovation, and a unique shopping experience.

This dataset focuses on Target's operations in Brazil, covering 100,000 orders placed between 2016 and 2018. It includes detailed information on order status, pricing, payment and shipping performance, customer locations, product attributes, and customer reviews.

## Files Included
- **`queries.sql`**: Contains the SQL queries used for data analysis. You can run these queries in any SQL client like MySQL Workbench to manipulate and analyze the dataset.
- **`analysis.ipynb`**: A Jupyter Notebook containing Python code. It connects to the MySQL database, runs the queries from `queries.sql`, processes the data, and visualizes the results using libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
- **`README.md`**: Instructions for setting up and running the project.

## Project Setup

### 1. Download the Dataset
To begin, download the dataset from the Kaggle link provided above.

### 2. Set Up the Database

1. Create a MySQL (or other SQL database) database and tables. 
2. Import the dataset into your database. If you need a reference schema, refer to the SQL queries in the `queries.sql` file.

### 3. Running SQL Queries
- Open the `queries.sql` file and run the queries using a MySQL client (such as MySQL Workbench or a Python-based SQL client).
- The queries will help you perform various analyses on the dataset.

### 4. Running the Jupyter Notebook
1. Open the `sql+python_ecommerce_project.ipynb` file in a Jupyter Notebook environment.
2. The notebook will:
   - Load the dataset (or connect to the database if the data is stored there).
   - Execute SQL queries from the `queries.sql` file using Python (via libraries like `mysql-connector-python` or `sqlalchemy`).
   - Perform data analysis using Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
   - Generate visualizations based on the analysis.

### 5. Dependencies
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed to run the notebook:
- Python 3.x
- MySQL (or another compatible SQL database)
- Pandas
- numpy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- mysql-connector-python (or sqlalchemy, if you prefer)

You can install the dependencies using pip:
```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn mysql-connector-python
